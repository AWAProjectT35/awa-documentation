## Git Pull Request

### Make Pull Request

If you want to make a pull request.

##### Go into the branch you want to change

`git checkout branch-you-want-to-change`

##### Make a new branch

`git checkout -b new-branch-name`

Do your changes in this branch.

##### Commit your changes

This adds all changes files into commit.

`git add -A`

This will make a commit of the changes.

`git commit -m "message what the commit does"`

> You can use `git status` and `git diff` or `git diff path/to/file` if you don't remember what you
have changed.

> Files can be added and committed one by one:
>
> `git add path/to/file`
> `git commit -m "what does this commit do"`
>
> `git add first/file/to/commit`
> `git add second/file/to/commit`
> `git commit -m "what does this change"`

##### Push the new branch to upstream

> `git status` is a good idea to check before pushing. If upstream happens to be ahead of your
branch it will lead into git merges.

`git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name`

branch.

##### Commit and push your own changes

`git push`

If everything is now in order go ahead and click `Merge pull request`.
